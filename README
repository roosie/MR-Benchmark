This is a repo for testing rabbitmq and redis message tranfer speed/efficiency between containers. Both technologies have their pros, cons, and use-cases not intended for this but I digress. 

TODO: 
- Determine best way to prevent race conditions on rabbitmq # fixed by adding hashmap to serve as state
- Implement redis (should be much easier than rabbit) # Implement suboptimally to give a fairer apples to apples comparison to what rabbitmq is doing
- Shift to k8s for scaling 

Current findings: 
- RabbitMQ takes 2.1s to sum 16 ints between 16 containers + RabbitMQ
- Redis takes 1.3s to sum 16 ints between 16 containers + Redis

Methodology
- Run map reduce to sum all of the node ids and have that value distributed among all machines 
- This should take about log(n)n messages
